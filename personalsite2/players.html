            <p id="player1" style="width: 500px; font-size: 30px;">Denver signed Badie to a reserve/future contract Monday, Jordan Schultz of BleacherReport.com reports.

                Badie was with the Broncos' practice squad since late October, and the team apparently saw enough to give him a chance to compete for a spot on their 53-man roster in OTAs and training camp. Badie boasts good speed, but at 5-foot-8, 197 lbs., it's unlikely he'll ever see a bellcow workload in the NFL.</p>

            <p id="player2" style="width: 500px; font-size: 30px;"> Tim Patrick is a wide receiver who played for the Denver Broncos in the NFL. Born on November 23, 1993, Patrick attended college at the University of Utah and later entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent, signing with the Baltimore Ravens in 2017. He joined the Broncos later that year and has since become a notable player for the team.

                Patrick is known for his physicality, route-running ability, and reliable hands, making him a valuable target in the Broncos' passing game. Despite facing competition for playing time in a crowded receiving corps, Patrick has carved out a significant role for himself within the team's offense.
                
                While specific statistics and achievements may vary depending on the time of inquiry, Patrick has demonstrated consistent performance and contributed to the Broncos' offensive efforts during his tenure with the team. He has earned praise for his work ethic, perseverance, and contributions on the field, establishing himself as a respected member of the Broncos' roster.

As he continues to develop and gain experience in the NFL, Surtain is expected to be a key player for the Broncos and a cornerstone of their defense for years to come.</p>
